# NBA-3PM-Linear-Regression
Uses basic linear regression to predict 3PM of a NBA player from various seasons

Scrapes [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) for the information

Testing out supervised machine learning, uses a players PTs scored in a season as the independent variable to predict the dependent variable 3PM

You can also use different fields for the dependent variable such as Minutes Played (MP).

You can change which variable is used for the prediction by using any of the column headers from the "Totals" table [here](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/hardeja01.html#totals)

**It's recommended to use a player with around 10+ seasons under their belt so there's more data for the model to train with**
